# Productivity Project

This is a simple personal project aimed at organizing and managing tasks efficiently. Over time, I will be continuously adding new features and improvements to make it more comprehensive and useful for day-to-day productivity. The tool allows users to **create**, **edit**, **delete**, and **manage** tasks in a simple and intuitive manner.

## Current Features

- **Create Tasks**: Add new tasks to your list, with detailed descriptions and deadlines.
- **Delete Tasks**: Easily remove tasks once they are completed or no longer needed.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify the content or deadlines of tasks at any time.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Track your progress by marking tasks as done.
- **View Pending and Completed Tasks**: Organize your tasks based on their status (pending or completed).

## Future Features

This project is under active development, and the following features are expected to be added in future updates:

- **Task Priority**: Assign priority levels to tasks (high, medium, low).
- **Automatic Reminders**: Receive notifications before tasks reach their deadline.
- **Subtasks**: Break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.
- **Calendar Integration**: Sync tasks with personal calendars (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.).
- **Productivity Reports and Analytics**: View detailed reports on your productivity over time.
